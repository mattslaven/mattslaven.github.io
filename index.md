# My beliefs
Supportive schools are the foundation for the strength of our community. By helping to guide our students on their developmental journey, we build our community brick by brick.

The responsibility of the board of education is to advise the superintendent on community attitudes. We do not manage day-to-day operations of a school district; we ensure the system is well managed by professional administrators.

I appreciate your input and feedback. As one of five members of the board, I look forward to the opportunity to do my part to help us work together.

# My background
I moved to Brimfield in 1974. My father taught at Field High School and my mother taught at Suffield Elemtary School.

I earned my engineering degree (BSEE) and business degree (MBA) from Duke University. I have worked for 25 years at Motorola, Ford and IBM.

I was appointed to the Field Local Schools Board of Education in January of 2024.
