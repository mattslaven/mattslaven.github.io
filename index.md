# My beliefs
I believe that supportive schools are the foundation for the strength of our community.

# My background
I moved to Brimfield in 1974. My father taught at Field High School and my mother taught at Suffield Elemtary School.

I earned my engineering degree (BSEE) and business degree (MBA) from Duke University. I have worked for 25 years at Motorola, Ford and IBM.

I was appointed to the Field Local Schools Board of Education in January of 2024.
