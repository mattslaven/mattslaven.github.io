## General Assembly
The 136th General Assembly officially began on Jan. 6, 2025. In regard to education-related bills, it is likely that property taxes will be an area of focus for both the Ohio House and Ohio Senate.

## Background
The Ohio Fair School Funding (FSF) Plan is bipartisan legislation introduced in the Ohio House of Representatives as House Bill 1 (HB 1) by Republican Rep. Jamie Callender and Democratic Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney. The bill created a new school financing system for K-12 education in the State of Ohio, overhauling the state's school funding system that the Ohio Supreme Court found unconstitutional four times beginning with the original DeRolph decision in 1997. HB 1 was signed into law on July 1, 2021 as a part of the biennial state operating budget.

## Legislative updates
Gov. Mike DeWine announced his last executive biennial budget on Feb. 3, 2025. The budget is for fiscal years 2026-27. While DeWine’s budget starts the process, the legislature largely crafts the finalized version. The budget proposal would continue the phase in of years five and six of the base cost component of the Fair School Funding (FSF) formula. One element of the formula that wasn’t included in DeWine’s budget was updating the base cost inputs. Without updating the inputs, the formula will become unbalanced and result in an overreliance on property taxes and a higher local share.

## Budget highlights
DeWine’s budget proposal also includes these education-related items:
<ul><li>invests $50 million over the biennium to create a new vision services program, OhioSEE, which would ensure that K-three students who fail vision screenings receive comprehensive eye exams and glasses, if needed;
<li>invests $30 million over the biennium to create a new school bus safety grant program based on the recommendations of the governor’s Ohio School Bus Safety Working Group, providing $4 million to increase the annual bus driver training requirement from four to six hours and widening access to advanced driver training;
<li>earmarks $12 million in lottery funds for Science of Reading literacy coaches and requires that schools with low rates of proficient readers focus more funding on literacy supports;
<li>dedicates $10 million over the biennium to the Ohio Principal Apprenticeship Program established in Senate Bill 168 of the 135th General Assembly;</li>
<li>invests $7 million each fiscal year in competitive grants to support career planning and workforce readiness initiatives for K-12 students;</li>
<li>creates the Driver Training in Schools Grant Program at the Ohio Department of Public Safety, funded by nonmedical marijuana sales tax revenue, for school districts to fund driver’s education at their high schools;</li>
<li>increases the Community School Facilities per pupil amount from $1,000 to $1,500;</li>
<li>continues the administration's work on school-based health, expanding the number of school-based health centers in high-need counties and providing resources and technical support to these health centers across the state.</li>
<li>continues state investments in school choice programs at levels similar to the current ones;</li>
