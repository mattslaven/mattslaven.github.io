# Ohio House passes budget bill

The biennial budget process takes several months to complete; it is introduced in early February and ends by June 30. During that process, both the Ohio House and Ohio Senate work to amend the budget based on each chamber’s funding priorities. On April 9, the Ohio House completed its budget work by amending House Bill 96, the biennial budget bill, and voting it out by a 60-39 vote.


## State funding formula
The Ohio House made several education-related changes, including how the state funds K-12 education. The House maintained the fair school funding formula in law, but made some changes for FY26 and FY27. The changes made were to ensure that every school district in the state receives more money than they received in fiscal year 2025 (FY25). A district will receive its state funding based on the sum of the following:
<ul><li>the district’s state foundation aid, less supplemental targeted assistance, for FY25;</li>
<li>an additional amount equal to 50% of the difference between the district’s foundation aid for the fiscal year and the district’s state foundation aid, less supplemental targeted assistance, for FY25, if the difference is positive.</li></ul>
Additionally, the House included payments to ensure that growing districts receive more funds and that districts do not receive funding below their FY25 funding. The bill language:
<ul><li>Provides an enrollment growth supplement in FY26 and FY27 to districts whose enrolled Average Daily Membership (ADM) grew by at least 3% between FY22 and FY25 for FY26 payments, and between FY23 and FY26 for the FY27 payments.</li>
<ul><li>The payment is calculated as follows:</li>
<ul><li>Districts that grew between 3%-5% will receive $150 per student in FY26 and $200 per student in FY27</li>
<li>Districts that grew between 5%-10% will receive $100 per student in FY26 and $150 in FY27</li>
<li>Districts that grew more than 10% will receive $50 per student in FY26 and $100 per student in FY27</li></ul></ul>
<li>Provides additional payments in FY26 and FY27 that guarantee a district’s temporary foundation funding does not fall below its FY25 foundation aid, including supplemental targeted assistance.</li></ul>
Finally, the House included additional funding changes and requirements:
<ul><li>Provides a base funding supplement in FY26 and FY27 equal to $20 per student in FY 26 and $30 per student in FY27.</li>
<li>Freezes the amount of special education funding withheld for high-cost special education students to what was withheld in FY25.</li>
<li>Requires districts to spend at least the amount that was spent in FY25 in the following categories:
<ul><li>special education funding;</li>
<li>disadvantaged pupil impact aid (DPIA);</li>
<li>English learner funding;</li>
<li>gifted funds, excluding gifted professional development;</li>
<li>career-technical education and career-technical associated services funding;</li>
<li>student wellness and success funding.</li></ul>
<li>Maintains current law regarding required uses of student wellness and success funds.</li>
<li>Prohibits any district from spending more than 15% of its annual operating budget on administrative salaries and benefits and other costs associated with the district’s administrative offices.</li>
</ul>
